# Changelog

## Unreleased

- v0.4 macro-editing work is in progress. The proposed one-tool
  `EditMacroProcedure` boundary is isolated `.xlsm` + save-copy only, plans a
  bounded selected procedure source/hash, and applies complete hash-guarded
  replacement without returning source. It is not yet a stable or
  desktop-Excel-verified release.

## 0.3.0 - 2026-08-09

- Added one closed operation union for copy-exhibit, existing-sheet formula
  repair, and stable right/down formula-series extension without adding a tool.
- Added bounded pre-mutation formula planning and revalidation, exact
  save/reopen verification, and a final isolated same-file live-binding check.
- Preserved all valid range changes and terminal verification checks across the
  private-worker and MCP receipt boundaries.
- Fixed the acceptance script to propagate failed test exit codes.
- Verified six serial desktop-Excel workflows and the real one-tool MCP path
  from an empty Excel baseline with no process left afterward.

## 0.2.0 - 2026-08-09

- Moved every Excel operation into a short-lived private worker so blocked COM
  cannot stall the MCP host indefinitely.
- Added bounded worker protocol, hard deadlines, worker-owned Excel recovery,
  exact staging cleanup, and non-retryable `Unknown` outcomes after uncertain
  dispatch.
- Verified the real one-tool MCP path through save, reopen, file-lock release,
  and owned-process cleanup.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-08-08

- First formula/exhibit MVP: copy a named worksheet, repair only unambiguous
  blank formulas, save, reopen, and verify.
- One `excel_task` MCP tool with compact structured receipts.
- Safety baseline: exact open-workbook handling, explicit overwrite approval,
  owned-process cleanup, staged saves, and truthful uncertain outcomes.
