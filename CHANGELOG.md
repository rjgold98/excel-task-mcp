# Changelog

## 0.5.0 - 2026-08-10

- Moved the work-computer field check into the released executable as
  `--field-check`, replacing `scripts/Invoke-FieldCheck.ps1`. Managed computers
  commonly run PowerShell in Constrained Language Mode, which forbids the COM and
  reflection the script needed; compiled code is unaffected. It is not an MCP tool
  and not a public CLI - the model-facing surface is still exactly one tool.
- The tool-surface comparison now measures the raw `tools/list` wire response over
  JSON-RPC rather than a re-serialization, so the reported bytes are the server's
  own. Use `--compare` and `--compare-arg` to measure another MCP server.
- Field-check fixture processes are tracked and excluded from the leak figures, so
  a stranded-Excel count can never be the harness mistaken for the product.
- Added `.vscode/mcp.json` so clients that sync a repository's MCP configuration
  pick up the `excel-task` server automatically.
- Added `docs/AGENT-BRIDGE.md`, defining how the lead and field agents divide
  work, task each other through issues, and report with evidence.

## 0.4.1 - 2026-08-10

- Added `scripts/Invoke-FieldCheck.ps1` and `docs/FIELD-CHECK.md` so the
  work-computer gates the roadmap has always required can actually be run. It
  reports the environment, measures the advertised tool surface against another
  MCP server, and times each operation against disposable workbooks. It changes
  no Excel or security setting.
- Fixed the test harness for per-user .NET installs. The MCP transports launch
  the server with environment inheritance disabled, so the framework-dependent
  apphost could not see `DOTNET_ROOT` and failed with `0x80008083` on machines
  with no machine-wide .NET, which is how the first work-computer run failed. The
  child environment now carries the runtime root that hosts the tests. Found by
  the 2026-08-10 work-computer validation run.
- Recorded the first work-computer validation: the complete suite passed 146/146
  there, including desktop Excel integration, macro editing with execution, and
  process cleanup. VBA project access is permitted on that machine.

## 0.4.0 - 2026-08-10

- Added bounded macro editing to the existing operation union: `Plan` returns one
  selected standard-module procedure with its hash, and `Apply` replaces exactly
  that procedure only while the hash still matches, then saves, reopens, and
  verifies an `.xlsm` copy. Signed and locked VBA projects are refused, automatic-entry
  procedures cannot be edited, and Trust Center settings are never changed.
- Fixed VBA object-model binding. The extensibility model exposes `VBComponents.Item`
  as a method and `CodeModule.ProcStartLine`/`ProcCountLines`/`Lines` as parameterized
  properties, which is the opposite of Excel's own collections; the previous binding
  raised `DISP_E_MEMBERNOTFOUND` and made every macro operation fail preflight.
- Fixed optional post-edit macro execution. Owned Excel force-disables macros, so
  `Application.Run` could never succeed; macros are now enabled only when a request
  explicitly asks to run the edited procedure, with workbook events still suppressed.
- Replaced the single generic macro-access failure with distinct reasons for a Trust
  Center block, a locked project, a missing component, a non-standard module, a missing
  procedure, and an oversized procedure.
- Accepted array parameters such as `values() As Variant` in procedure signatures.
- Stopped re-checking plan source against the replacement grammar, which silently
  returned a successful plan with no source for valid but unparseable procedures.
  Oversized source is still omitted rather than truncated.
- Verified through the real one-tool MCP path against desktop Excel, including
  plan, hash-guarded replacement, post-edit run, save/reopen, and process cleanup.
- Split the Excel runtime into one file per type plus focused partials for the
  formula and session areas. This is a move-only change: the set of code lines is
  unchanged, and the same tests pass before and after.
- Added an explicit owned-process cleanup assertion to the desktop macro test,
  because editing VBA materializes the VBE and that is the most likely way this
  workflow could strand an Excel process.

## 0.3.0 - 2026-08-09

- Added one closed operation union for copy-exhibit, existing-sheet formula
  repair, and stable right/down formula-series extension without adding a tool.
- Added bounded pre-mutation formula planning and revalidation, exact
  save/reopen verification, and a final isolated same-file live-binding check.
- Preserved all valid range changes and terminal verification checks across the
  private-worker and MCP receipt boundaries.
- Fixed the acceptance script to propagate failed test exit codes.
- Verified six serial desktop-Excel workflows and the real one-tool MCP path
  from an empty Excel baseline with no process left afterward.

## 0.2.0 - 2026-08-09

- Moved every Excel operation into a short-lived private worker so blocked COM
  cannot stall the MCP host indefinitely.
- Added bounded worker protocol, hard deadlines, worker-owned Excel recovery,
  exact staging cleanup, and non-retryable `Unknown` outcomes after uncertain
  dispatch.
- Verified the real one-tool MCP path through save, reopen, file-lock release,
  and owned-process cleanup.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-08-08

- First formula/exhibit MVP: copy a named worksheet, repair only unambiguous
  blank formulas, save, reopen, and verify.
- One `excel_task` MCP tool with compact structured receipts.
- Safety baseline: exact open-workbook handling, explicit overwrite approval,
  owned-process cleanup, staged saves, and truthful uncertain outcomes.
