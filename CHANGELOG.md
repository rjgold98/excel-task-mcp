# Changelog

## 0.2.0 - 2026-08-09

- Moved every Excel operation into a short-lived private worker so blocked COM
  cannot stall the MCP host indefinitely.
- Added bounded worker protocol, hard deadlines, worker-owned Excel recovery,
  exact staging cleanup, and non-retryable `Unknown` outcomes after uncertain
  dispatch.
- Verified the real one-tool MCP path through save, reopen, file-lock release,
  and owned-process cleanup.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-08-08

- First formula/exhibit MVP: copy a named worksheet, repair only unambiguous
  blank formulas, save, reopen, and verify.
- One `excel_task` MCP tool with compact structured receipts.
- Safety baseline: exact open-workbook handling, explicit overwrite approval,
  owned-process cleanup, staged saves, and truthful uncertain outcomes.
